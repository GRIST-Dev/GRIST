# Global-Regional Integrated Forecast System (GRIST)

[**Online Tutorial**](https://grist-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  

- **Model Version:** 1.2  
- **Latest Code Version:** A25.7.1, Fortran

---

## ‚ú® Features

-  **Global-Regional Integrated Dynamical Core**: The concept of Global-Regional Integration can be represented in various ways, including global uniform high-resolution (km-scale) models, global models with localized high-resolution areas, and global and regional models developed within the same codebase, such that the regional model is a truncated version of the global model. All of these approaches are pursued by GRIST in an integrated manner, optimizing resource input.
-  **Two Integrated Physics Suites**:  
  - **PhysW / AMIPW_Physics**  
  - **PhysC / AMIPC_Physics**  
-  **Simplified Models** for testing physics and numerical operators.
-  **Extensive Testing** across multiple configurations:  
   Single-column mode  
   Shallow-water mode  
   3D dry/moist idealized dynamics  
   AMIP, NWP-style, and GSRM  
-  **Custom Diagnostic Templates** for various applications *(see the [GRIST tutorial](https://grist-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for details)*.
-  **Cost effective computational performance**: week-scale SDPD for GSRM-scale applications on normal CPU machines.

## General Usage

1. **Modify Environment Setup**  
   - Edit `build.sh` in the "build" directory on your local machine.  
   - Choose a model type (e.g., `amipw` or `amipc`).  
   - Run:  
     ```bash
     ./build.sh amipw  # or ./build.sh amipc
     ```
   
2. **Compilation**  
   - After successful compilation, the following files are generated:  
     - `ParGRIST_amipw.exe / ParGRIST_amipc.exe` (Model executable)  
     - `partition.exe`  
   - Place the model executable in the **"run"** directory for each case.  

3. **Running the Model**  
   - Prepare **namelist files** and necessary **input data**.  
   - Ensure the required **runtime environment** is set up.  
   - Submit the job for execution.  

4. **Quick start**
   - To quickly familiarize one with running the model, it is highly recommended to utilize the assets provided in this paper: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/6301/2024/gmd-17-6301-2024.html. These assets include the frozen model code, compilation and runtime configurations, and the input data required to reproduce each case.

## GRIST Kernel

The **GRIST_kernel** is the **minimum codebase** supporting all GRIST v1.0 functions, including results from published papers *(bit regression is ensured for identical setups and environments)*.  

- **GRIST_kernel** can be **easily extended** with **GRIST_increm** (add-on modules) with minimal effort.

A mixed-precision dynamical core (Fig. 3) has been developed to reduce the computa- tional load, which maintains the stability and accuracy of the original double-precision code based on a careful itera- tive development procedure and a hierarchy of tests. This mixed-precision dynamical core is detailed in section 3.4.*

### Conclusion

The 1 km GSRM Nonhydrostatic Atmosphere simulation requires solving 11 Prognostic equations for 3D Variables, while accounting for sound waves propagating at speeds of 340‚Äì350 m/s across the entire Earth Sphere (~500 million edges, at one layer), under realistic surface topography and physics-dynamics coupling. These factors collectively make it an extremely challenging computational task.

By leveraging AI-trained physics suites, a generalized programming model, and mixed-precision computing, global weather and climate simulations are making significant strides toward higher accuracy, efficiency, and integration. These advancements provide more powerful tools for extreme weather prediction and deeper insights into climate change. This work serves as an initial step toward further exploration and innovation in this promising direction.
